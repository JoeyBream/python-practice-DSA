    "### Time complexity\n",
    "1. O(5n) and O(n/2) are both of order O(n). This is because they both increase linearly with the change in input n. Ignore factors.\n",
    "2. O(2^n + 5n^2 + 3n) is of order O(2^n). Only consider the largest factor in the algorithm\n",
    "3. We generally want to consider best case, worst case and average case complexity. E.g. O(n), O(n), O(n^2).\n",
    "4. Logarithmic time O(log n) is very fast. O(n*log n) is also very fine. (Also note, O(log n) comes when our algorithm is doing a percentage fewer calculations at each step, e.g. in a binary search. We start doing n operations, then we do n/2, then n/4."
